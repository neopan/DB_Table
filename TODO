==========================================================================
For release 1.60

1) Add a DB_Table_Datbase::join() method that returns a query array for a 
   query that joins a specified set of pairs of tables. Unlike autoJoin(), 
   this requires that pairs of table to be joined be specified explicitly. 

2) Add left joins to join and autoJoin, by declaring some of the tables 
   in the $tables parameter to be "optional". Table name values in the 
   $tables parameter that are prefixed with a colon (e.g., ':TableName') 
   will be interpreted as "optional" tables and will be OUTER JOINed to 
   the INNER JOINed set of "required" tables.

3) Add column and table aliases to autoJoin.  Extend the autoJoin 
   interface to interpret string keys in the $cols and $tables parameter 
   arrays as aliases: Allow the syntax
   $cols = array( alias1 => column_name_1, alias2 => column_name_2, ...) 
   to represent 'SELECT column_name_1 as alias1, column_name_2 as alias2, 
   ...".  Keys that are strings will be interpreted as aliases, but integer 
   keys will not.

4) Refinements of _sleep and __wakeup() methods of DB_Table_Database and 
   DB_Table.  Add further error checking.  Add ability to store DSN to 
   the __sleep methods and ability to reconnect to the database to the 
   __wakeup method.

5) Add further checks of foreign key reference sanity to the addRef method: 
   i)  Check for nullify actions on required columns
   ii) Check if referenced key is a unique or primary key

6) Registration of sequences with tables using $seq property. Auto-dropping
   of associated sequences when a table is dropped.

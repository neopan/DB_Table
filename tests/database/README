This directory contains unit tests, which use the PHPUnit2 framework
(for PHP 5) or PHPUnit (for PHP 4). As distributed, the tests are set
up to use PHPUnit2, but can be converted to PHPUnit 4 by changing two
lines in each test - the require_once line for the test framework, 
and the class definition for each unit test, which includes the name 
of the unit test class that is being extended. In both cases, the 
line required for PHP 4 PHPUnit framework is commented out. 

The tests are not yet fully automated - determination of correctness
of some of the tests requires either inspection of the results, or 
comparison to the results of a previous run (i.e., simple regression 
testing). Succesful outputs are thus provided with each test. Fully
automated versions of these tests will be provided in a future 
release.

Short instructions
------------------

To run PHPUnit2 unit tests for DB_Table_Database:

    1) Install PHPUnit2 or PHPUnit. If using the PHP 4 PHPUnit class
    modify each of the unit tests (the files named <TestName>_Test.php)
    by changing the require_once and class definition lines.

    2) Copy the DB_Table/tests/config.php-dist file to
    DB_Table/tests/databse/config.php in this directory, and edit the
    the parts of the DSN in DB_Table/tests/database/config.php file to 
    allow connection to your RDBMS server. If using a database other
    than MySQL, some other changes in this file may be required (see
    below).

    3) cd into the DB_Table/tests/database directory (this directory).
    For each file named TestName_Test.php in this directory, issue 
    the command "phpunit TestName" from the command line.

    4) If the tests all run successfully, diff the output against the
    corresponding *.out file. The only difference should be the line 
    reporting the amount of time required by the test.

config.php file
---------------
The tests will repeatedly create and tear down a database named $db_name. 
In the distributed version, this database in named 'Test_DB1' by default.

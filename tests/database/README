This directory contains unit tests for the DB_Table_Database class, 
which use the PHPUnit2 framework (for PHP 5) or PHPUnit (for PHP 4). 
All of the Unit test classes extent a base class DatabaseClass, 
which contains setUp() and teardown() methods for a test database.  
DatabaseClass extends an abstract class DataTestClass (defined in
the DB_Table/tests directory above), which is a more generic class 
for TestCase objects that can do regression testing of variable 
values. 

As distributed, the tests are set up to use PHPUnit2, but can be 
converted to the PHP 4 PHPUnit package by changing two lines in the 
tests/DataTestClass.php file - the require_once line for the test 
framework, and the class definition line, which includes the name 
of the generic unit test class that is being extended. In both 
cases, the lines required for PHP 4 PHPUnit framework are commented 
out in the distributed file. 

The data files used in regression tests for each TestCase class are
stored in directories, such that the name of each directory is the
name of the corresponding TestCase class, and the name of the file
is the test method. Data files and data file directories are created
only for methods and classes that use regression tests.

Examples of successful outputs of each test case are given in the
/tests/database/out directory.

Short instructions
------------------

To run PHPUnit2 unit tests for DB_Table_Database:

    1) Install PHPUnit2 or PHPUnit. If using the PHP 4 PHPUnit class
    modify DatabaseClass as described above.

    2) Copy the DB_Table/tests/config.php-dist file to
    DB_Table/tests/databse/config.php in this directory, and edit the
    the parts of the DSN in DB_Table/tests/database/config.php file to 
    allow connection to your RDBMS server. This file may be configured
    to test with either DB or MDB2 backend. If using a database other
    than MySQL, some other changes in this file and to the setup and
    teardown methods of the DatabaseTest class may be required (see
    below). 

    3) Create an empty database named (by default) 'TestDB1'

    4) cd into the DB_Table/tests/database directory (this directory).
    For each file named TestName_Test.php in this directory, issue 
    the command "phpunit TestName" from the command line.

config.php file
---------------
The tests will repeatedly create and drop all of the tables of a database 
named $db_name.  In the distributed version, this database is named 
'Test_DB1' by default. The setUp() and tearDown() methods create and
drop new tables for each test instance, but not the database itself.
An empty database with named $db_name must be created before the tests 
are run.

Other information
-----------------

The data files used in regression tests for each TestCase class are
stored in directories, such that the name of each directory is the
name of the corresponding TestCase class, and the name of the file
is the test method. Data files and data file directories are created
only for methods and classes that use regression tests.

Examples of successful outputs of each test case are given in the
/tests/database/out directory.

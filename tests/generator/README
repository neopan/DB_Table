To test the DB_Table_Generator class:

  1) Copy the DB_Table/tests/config.php-dist file to DB_Table/tests/config.php
  2) Edit the parts of the DSN string in the config.php file to connect to your server
  3) Change $db_name in config.php to the name of an existing database
  4) Run 'php test.php' from the command line within this directory

Upon completion, you should have a new subdirectory of DB_Table/tests/generator for 
which the directory name is the name of the database. In it should be DB_Table subclass 
definitions for all of the tables in the database, and a 'Database.php' file. The
'Database.php' file contains code to require_once all these DB_Table subclass 
definitions, to connect to the database, to create one instance of each DB_Table 
subclass, and to create a DB_Table_Database parent object. The Database.php file
is not referred to by any other auto-generated file, and so can be renamed. This
file should normally be included in any php script that uses the auto-generated
DB_Table infrastructure.

The generator does not yet attempt to guess foreign key references or linking tables,
so these should be added manually to the Database.php file, using the addRef()
and addLink() or addAllLinks() methods of DB_Table_Database.

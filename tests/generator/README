To test the generator script:

  1) Copy the DB_Table/tests/config.php-dist file to DB_Table/tests/config.php
  2) Edit the parts of the DSN string in the config.php file to connect to your server
  3) Change $db_name in config.php to the name of an existing database
  4) Run 'php test.php' from within this directory

Upon completion, you should have a new subdirectory of DB_Table/tests/generator for
which the name is the name of the database. In it are DB_Table subclass definitions 
for all of the tables in the database, and a 'Database.php' file that contains code
to includes all these class definitions, connect to the database, creates one 
instance of each DB_Table subclass, and create a DB_Table_Database parent object.
The code to create a DNS for connection to the database will need to be edited.

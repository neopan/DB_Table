        <notes>
            * MULTIPLE BC BREAKS related to naming conventions, mostly
              because of Oracle.  Read and heed the following two notes
              before you upgrade.
              
			* BC BREAK on name lengths:
			
				Table, column, index, and sequence names are now limited
				to 30 characters at table-creation time via the create()
				method in Manager.php.  This means that column names and
				must be no longer than 30 characters.
				
				More confusingly, this means that generated index names
				can be no longer than 30 characters total. DB_Table
				generates index names using the table name, an
				underscore, the index name, and a '_idx' suffix. This
				combination of rules is to soothe PostgreSQL (which does
				not allow identical index names even if they are on
				different tables) and Oracle (which has a 30-char limit
				on index names).  This means that the table name
				combined with the index name cannot be longer than 25
				characters (becuase of the separating underscore and the
				'_idx' suffix).  Yes, this sucks.  Well, Oracle sucks. 
				:-(
				
				Error codes and messages have been added to notify of
				the new rules. effect.  This should only affect users
				who are starting new tables with DB_Table and should not
				affect existing tables and indexes.
                
			* BC BREAK on sequences:
			
				If no sequence name is defined in a call to nextID(),
				DB_Table used to default to '_table_id' as the name of
				the sequence, and DB would take that to create a
				'_table_id_seq' sequence name. However, Oracle will not
				allow a sequence name to start with '_'.
				
				For Oracle compliance, and in the interest of
				consistency between DB and DB_Table, as well as keeping
				names under 30 chars, DB_Table now uses only the table
				name as the default, which means that DB translates this
				into 'tablename_seq'.
				
				Users of DB_Table should rename their sequences to
				remove the initial underscore and change the trailing
				'_id_seq' to just '_seq' for any automatically-generated
				sequence names.  If you do not, the upgrade to DB_Table
				0.23.0 will create a new sequence restarting at 1 with
				the new non-underscored different-suffix name on the
				first call to nextID().
              
            * Added 'autocomplete' as a supported element, per Alex
              Hobart.
            
            * Added new keys to the $sql property to support per-query
              'fetchmode' and 'fetchmode_object_class' settings.  Patch
              provided by Ian Eure.

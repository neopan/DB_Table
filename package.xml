            Short summary:
            * New table creation modes 'verify' and 'alter'
            * Primary keys are now supported
            * MDB2 is now supported as database backend
            * Firebird DBMS is now supported (but Interbase isn't)
            * Auto-creation of QuickForm rules can be disabled now
            * Usage of custom QuickForm elements is now more flexible
            * Internationalizing/customizing of error messages now easier

            Minor changes in detail:

            * Improvement related to bug report #5679: many arrays (in the
              table definition and as function parameters) may now be null
              (of course, an empty array is still allowed).
            * The column definition array $col may not be empty because it
              isn't possible to create empty database tables and because
              the work with DB_Table makes only sense with at least one
              column.
            * Fixed several return by reference problems (that caused
              notices in PHP 4.4.x and 5.x).
            * Fixed several "undefined index" problems (causing notices).
            * Bugfix: select() and selectResult() didn't return error
              objects caused due to problems in $sql array.
            * Bugfix: static usage of DB_Table_QuickForm::createForm()
              resulted in fatal error when 'formName' wasn't specified
              in the $args parameter.
            * Request #5965: Turn off automatic setting of default QF rules
              like 'numeric' or 'required' (can be done by setting
              $cols[...]['qf_set_default_rules'] = false).
              (thanks to Arne Bippes)
            * Bug #6025: DB_Table no longer tries to create a table if a
              table with the same name but with different use of lower and
              upper letters.
            * Request #6036: new qf_type 'callback' which allows to add
              custom QF elements that need more than the standard
              parameters. You need to specify a key named 'qf_callback',
              filled with either the name of a class (this class needs to
              have a method 'createElement') or the name of a method.
              Both method types must return true if the element was created
              successfully. (thanks to Arne Bippes)
            * The dependency on the Date package was removed.
            * In addition to the option to internationalize some error messages
              via $GLOBALS['_DB_TABLE']['error'], you can now use
              setErrorMessage() like this (assuming $obj is your DB_Table instance):
                $obj->setErrorMessage(DB_TABLE_ERR_PHPTYPE, 'localized message');
              or to set more than one message:
                $obj->setErrorMessage(array(DB_TABLE_ERR_PHPTYPE => 'message 1',
                                            DB_TABLE_ERR_NOT_DB_OBJECT => 'message 2'));
              Static calls (DB_Table::setErrorMessage(...)) are also valid.
              Setting the error messages via a static call or $GLOBALS is
              especially needed for errors that can occur with-in the
              constructor call (i.e. e.g. creating or altering the database table).

            Major changes / enhancements in detail:

            * Request #5478: Verification/check, whether the table exists,
              whether all the columns exist, whether the columns have the
              right type, and whether the indexes exists. This can be used
              by setting $create in the constructor of your extended class
              to 'verify' instead of false/'safe'/'drop'. In case of an
              error in the schema, you will find the PEAR_Error object in
              $obj->error (assuming $obj is your DB_Table instance).
              - This is not available for 'fbsql' and 'mssql' phptypes.
                ('fbsql' is likely to be not supported in the future, while
                'mssql' will be added when MDB2 has support for index and
                constraint information for this DBMS.)
            * New creation mode 'alter': If the table does not exist, it will
              be created. Otherwise, table fields' existance and types will be
              checked and, if needed, the field(s) will be added or changed. The
              same applies for indexes' and constraints' existance and types.
              Columns/indexes/constraints that don't exist anymore in the table
              definition class, will NOT be removed.              
              - This is a new and powerful feature, use it with caution -- changing
                a string datatype into a numeric datatype in your table definition
                class may lead to data loss.
              - Using " $_DB_TABLE['debug'] = true; " in your scripts will
                output what will be changed. If something unexpected is changed,
                please report it via PEAR's bug tracker (please include the
                debug message and the column and/or index definition from your
                table definition class, thanks).
              - This is not available for 'fbsql' and 'mssql' phptypes.
                ('fbsql' is likely to be not supported in the future, while
                'mssql' will be added when MDB2 has support for index and
                constraint information for this DBMS.)
              (thanks to Arne Bippes for the initial idea)
            * Support for primary keys: In the $idx array one index can be
              marked as 'primary' and will be created as the primary key of
              the chosen table.
              - This not available for 'sqlite' phptype, as SQLite does not
                support primary keys.
            * Request #6384: DB_Table now supports also MDB2 as the database
              backend. Just pass an MDB2 instance instead of a DB instance to
              the constructor. (thanks to Lukas Smith for the initial patch)
            * DB_Table now supports the Firebird DBMS (version >= 1.5
              required). Because of the limited features of Interbase
              (its ancestor), only Firebird is supported. Therefore,
              'dbsyntax' must be set to 'firebird' in your DSN. Please note
              that the ibase extension is very buggy in PHP 4, while it works
              good with PHP 5.
            
            Only relevant if you are using localized error messages:
            * Please note that there are eleven new error messages and that the
              messages for DB_TABLE_ERR_NOT_DB_OBJECT and DB_TABLE_ERR_PHPTYPE
              slightly differ from the old messages.

            * WARNING: MULTIPLE BC BREAKS related to naming conventions,
              mostly because of Oracle.  Read and heed the following two notes
              before you upgrade.  These are per email conversations with,
              patches from, and suggestions by Alex Hoebart.
              
            * BC BREAK on name lengths:
            
              Table, column, index, and sequence names are now limited
              to 30 characters at table-creation time via the create()
              method in Manager.php.  This means that column names and
              must be no longer than 30 characters.
              
              More confusingly, this means that generated index names
              can be no longer than 30 characters total. DB_Table
              generates index names using the table name, an
              underscore, the index name, and a '_idx' suffix. This
              combination of rules is to soothe PostgreSQL (which does
              not allow identical index names even if they are on
              different tables) and Oracle (which has a 30-char limit
              on index names).  This means that the table name
              combined with the index name cannot be longer than 25
              characters (becuase of the separating underscore and the
              '_idx' suffix).  Yes, this sucks.  Well, Oracle sucks. 
              :-(
              
              Error codes and messages have been added to notify of
              the new rules. effect.  This should only affect users
              who are creating new tables with DB_Table and should not
              affect existing tables and indexes.
              
            * BC BREAK on sequences:
            
              If no sequence name is defined in a call to nextID(),
              DB_Table used to default to '_table_id' as the name of
              the sequence, and DB would take that to create a
              '_table_id_seq' sequence name. However, Oracle will not
              allow a sequence name to start with '_'.  In addition,
              Oracle has a maximum length of 30 for sequence names.
              
              For Oracle compliance, and in the interest of
              consistency between DB and DB_Table, as well as keeping
              names under 30 chars, DB_Table now uses only the table
              name as the default, which means that DB translates this
              into 'tablename_seq'.  Also, the nextID() method will 
              check to make sure the sequence name will end up being 
              no longer than 30 chars.
              
              Users of DB_Table should rename their sequences to
              remove the initial underscore and change the trailing
              '_id_seq' to just '_seq' for any automatically-generated
              sequence names.  If you do not, the upgrade to DB_Table
              0.23.0 will create a new sequence restarting at 1 with
              the new non-underscored different-suffix name on the
              first call to nextID().
              
            * Added 'autocomplete' as a supported element, per Alex
              Hobart.
            
            * Added new keys to the $sql property to support per-query
              'fetchmode' and 'fetchmode_object_class' settings.  Patch
              provided by Ian Eure.
            
            * Quickform.php addRules() method now supports any registered
              rule.  Patch provided by Alex Hoebart.
            
            * Valid.php isChar() is less restrictive and allows numbers
              in character fields.  Patch provided by Alex Hoebart.
            
            * Fixed bug 2799 "error in getFormElement", patch provided
              by David Glenn.

            * Fixed bug 2918 "recast($data) timestamp zero packing",
              reported by Simon Massey.

            * Added selectCount() method to let you get a row-count
              on an existing query; patch provided by Ian Eure.
